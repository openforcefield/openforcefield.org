However, with every force field comes the inherent assumption that parameters fit to a set of representative molecules in a training set are transferable to any new molecules with similar chemistry. Despite potential accuracy problems caused by poor transferability or discrete atom types the use of force fields in fields like drug discovery has been a massive success.</description></item><item><title>Oct 20, 2021 Advisory Board Meeting</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2021-10-20-minutes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2021-10-20-minutes/</guid><description>The Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board met on October 20, 2021.

This is a lot to parse in one sentence, so let&amp;rsquo;s break it down!
Lennard-Jones parameterization relies on physical properties Since the earliest days of force field science, LJ parameters have been fitted against physical property datasets ( typically liquid densities and heats of vaporization).</description></item><item><title>OpenFF 2.0.0 force field release (Sage)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/sage2.0.0-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/sage2.0.0-release/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce that OpenFF 2.0.0, the first release of the Sage line of force fields, is now available to download!

This has a lot of benefits and makes parameter design and force field fitting a unique experience. Because of this uniqueness I have found a need to use SMARTS in a way that just hasn&amp;rsquo;t been needed until now. SMARTS are normally applied to a SMILES pattern which makes SMARTS a type of substructure query on a molecule.</description></item><item><title>Jul 21, 2021 Advisory Board Meeting</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2021-07-21-minutes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2021-07-21-minutes/</guid><description>The Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board met on July 21, 2021.

A big part of this process is automation.</description></item><item><title>OpenFF team - welcomes and farewells</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/new-members-june2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/new-members-june2021/</guid><description>The OpenFF team went through some changes in the first half of 2021 &amp;ndash; we are excited to welcome six new members to our team and to see some of our old teammates move on to exciting new roles.

Boothroyd moved from the Chodera lab at MKSCC, New York to the Shirts lab at CU Boulder, Colorado OpenFF is hiring more personnel, primarily software scientists OFF toolkit update Version 0.6.0 released, with support for LibraryCharges (SMARTS-based charge assignment) Release notes here Currently only TIP3P is available, open to contributions of residue SMARTS-based protein FF Important to note changes in charge assignment: All molecules must be assigned charges by some method (charge_from_molecules counts) If partial charges don’t add up to formal charge, an error is raised Upcoming features: ChargeIncrementModel: Several semiempirical methods paired with SMARTS-based BCCs Contributors guide and developer documentation (expectations for user experience and code) OpenEye dependencies OE tools are used in some of the OpenFF workflows, but the long term goal is to make Open Force Fields and fitting infrastructure independent of OE licenses The goal is to make Open Force fields usable without OE dependence as soon as possible and we are working hard to make that happen, while the infrastructure used to build force fields will keep the current OE tools incorporated for a while longer, depending on the available developer time J.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (October 17, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-10-17/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-10-17/</guid><description>This meeting was the first dedicated Property Estimator call after several weeks of focus on producing and benchmarking release-1 (Parsley / openff-1.0.0.offxml). It focused on deciding future directions toward publication, infrastructure development, and lining up for the next FF release.
Once Simon Boothroyd begins work in Colorado, Simon and Owen will present a proposed Property Estimator paper outline to the consortium. This will involve choosing which of several existing questions to address, including: The extent to which our current functional form introduces errors in polyhalogenated compounds, due to an inability to model sigma holes.</description></item><item><title>Oct 16, 2019 Advisory Board Meeting</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2019-10-16-minutes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2019-10-16-minutes/</guid><description>The Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board had an in-person meeting during the Consortium workshop in San Diego (Aug 30-31, 2091), discussing research questions of interest and potential future directions for the Open Force Field Initiative. This and other discussions held during the meeting made a basis for the roadmap for Year 2. This was the joint August/September meeting.
The minutes from the meeting held on Oct 16, 2019 are summarized as follows:</description></item><item><title>The Open Force Field 1.0 small molecule force field, our first optimized force field (codename "Parsley")</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/</guid><description>We’re delighted to announce the release of &amp;ldquo;Parsley&amp;rdquo;, the Open Force Field 1.0 small molecule force field&amp;mdash;the first in a series of iteratively-improved small molecule force fields for biomolecular simulation funded in part by the Open Force Field Consortium. This is the first optimized force field to use the SMIRNOFF force field specification for atom type-free direct chemical perception, and provides substantially improved valence (bond, angle, and torsion) parameters relative to its predecessor, the AMBER-lineage SMIRNOFF99Frosst.</description></item><item><title>Webinar by Yuanqing Wang: Graph Nets for partial charge prediction (Oct 14, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/webinar-wang-oct2019/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/webinar-wang-oct2019/</guid><description>Yuanqing Wang(MSKCC) will give a talk about using Graph Nets for fast prediction of atomic partial charges.

**Abstract:** Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become increasingly popular in studying the motions and functions of biomolecules. The accuracy of the simulation, however, is highly determined by the classical force field (FF), a set of functions with adjustable parameters to compute the potential energy from atomic positions.</description></item><item><title>Release-1 update (Aug 15, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/release-1-update-2019-08-20/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/release-1-update-2019-08-20/</guid><description>Chemical coverage C. Bayly suggested broadly dividing parameters into two categories: 1) chemistry being covered in the first optimization run; 2) everything else. The latter category should also include information about all molecules that were cleaned out from databases used in the first optimization sprint, which was focused on improvement of a selected (sub)set of parameters. This information (data) can be used in the later stages of the force field optimization when chemical coverage will be expanded.</description></item><item><title>Webinar by Pankaj R.

Currently, the HCT, OBC1, and OBC2 models (corresponding to AMBER keywords igb=1, 2, and 5, respectively) are supported, with the OBC2 implementation being the most flexible. Unfortunately, systems produced using these keywords are not yet transferable to other simulation packages via ParmEd, so users are restricted to using OpenMM to simulate systems with GBSA.
OFFXML files containing GBSA parameter definitions are available, and can be loaded in addition to existing parameter sets, for example, with the command:</description></item><item><title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Aug 08, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-08-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-08-08/</guid><description>Datasets: Still waiting for NIST approval for data release from ThermoML. DIPPR was contacted to explain the terms of use for their data in more details. DIPPR contains pure component data on industrially important chemical compounds.
PropertyEstimator: PropertyEstimator (PE) and ForceBalance (FB) seem to be working well based on the preliminary tests run by S. Boothroyd, and the infrastructure is ready for the initial LJ fitting. There are some differences in the gradients calculated by PE and FB.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (August 6, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-08-06/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-08-06/</guid><description>Release-1:: In this meeting, L.-P.Wang and Y. Qiu reported on the results of a newly-implemented workflow which performs a MM minimization of torsion-driven structures before parameter optimization. Y. Qiu showed some results of the fitting with this change. It was generally agreed that this additional step improved the quality of the fitting, and was helpful in almost all cases. It was suggested that L.-P. Wang and Y. Qiu prepare a blog post of this information, but in the interest of time, this was deprioritized until after release-1.</description></item><item><title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Jul 25, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-07-25/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-07-25/</guid><description>Today the PropertyEstimator group discussed our progress, moving forward towards our fitting process with ThermoML data and ForceBalance. Decisions about fitting techniques and data have been made, and we are moving on to testing and production.
Database readiness
S. Boothroyd has algorithmically selected a basic set from the ThermoML archive with coverage of our selected Lennard Jones parameters. For basic fitting, we are moving forward with this dataset; if time allows we will also include a hand-curated ThermoML dataset provided by Lee-Ping Wang.</description></item><item><title>Jul 17, 2019 Advisory Board Meeting</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2019-07-17-minutes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2019-07-17-minutes/</guid><description>The Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board met on July 17, 2019. The minutes are summarized below.
The Advisory Board format was slightly changed on this occasion - the report about the latest development was sent before the meeting to leave more time for questions and discussions. We will test this new format during the next few meetings. Feedback and comments are welcome!

Datasets: Y. Qiu reported on the current status of QM data generation and parameter fitting. Currently, the two major datasets are the “Roche” set, and the “coverage” set. QM calculations on these sets have been scheduled to generate optimized geometries, torsion energy profiles, and hessians for each molecule.</description></item><item><title>Release-1 update (Jul 16, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/2019-07-16-release-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/2019-07-16-release-1/</guid><description>Types We will use the same typing tree as smirnoff99Frosst (with some minor adjustments to specific bugs or other problems), but optimize the differentiable parameters in (a subset of) torsion, valence, and Lennard-Jones parameters.
Parameterization We will aim to refit (a subset of) torsions, valence terms, and Lennard-Jones parameters, depending on what is ready in time. In practice, we have decoupled efforts to fit all three that should be straightforward to couple together in our final optimization stage.</description></item><item><title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Jul 11, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-07-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-07-11/</guid><description>Dataset sources
NIST update: Data that was collected and curated in an automated process by NIST could be released as an open dataset, but not the manually curated uncertainties, which is the step that follows automated curation. Additional problem may arise from the fact that data from before 10 years ago simply isn’t present in ThermoML. Until the situation is clear from the legal perspective, it has been decided to move forward using the data from an older release of ThermoML which contained author-assigned uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Jul 9, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-07-09/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-07-09/</guid><description>Fragmenter: C. Stern is working making fragmenter more interoperable and more suitable for an automated pipeline. Some of the features include using Omega to identify rotatable bonds and Wiberg bond order computations.
QC datasets: The &amp;ldquo;Roche set&amp;rdquo; (468 molecules) is almost done in terms of generating QC data for initial round of fitting with ForceBalance. The currently calculated data includes ~820 1-D torsion scans and geometry optimizations, and the next step is computing hessians.</description></item><item><title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Jun 27, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-06-27/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-06-27/</guid><description>Property selection: Discussion about which properties and the exact amount of data to be requested from NIST continues. One of the challenges is to find the right balance between the current and future parameterization needs, which includes making decisions about specific properties to be used for the first optimization sprint and specific chemistry that will be covered in this sprint (and maybe in the next one). For the latter, finding a set of molecules (SMILES) that exercise all SMIRNOFF parameters is desirable and J.</description></item><item><title>Towards New Fixed Charge Models</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/2019-07-05-charge-model-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/2019-07-05-charge-model-update/</guid><description>The Open Force Field Initiative continues to explore new partial charge assignment models for both fast parameterization (to allow billion-compound sets to be rapidly parameterized for docking) and a more accurate &amp;ldquo;bespoke&amp;rdquo; parameterization pipeline for torsions and partial charges (intended for use with more accurate but more costly methods, such as free energy calculations).&amp;quot;

Qiu updated TorsionDrive with visualization and more documentation. He is planning to add functionality to TorsionDrive to store gradients, which are currently computed, but not recorded. D. Smith suggested having a schema defined for TorsionDrive jobs for future use, to facilitate using it in larger project infrastructure.
Torsion/Valence Fitting: There was discussion of when fitting with ForceBalance might start. L.-P. Wang estimated that, provided with our first round of finished QC calculations, ForceBalance might take about a day to run before providing an optimized set of parameters.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (May 02, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-05-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-05-02/</guid><description>Benchmarking protein-ligand free energy: A set of suitable protein-ligand structures that will be used for the initial force field fitting/benchmarking during Year 1 (likely in September) needs to be selected. J. Chodera suggested the D3R Grand Challenge set as a starting point, but it needs to be filtered to remove any structures that might make benchmarking more complicated. For example, the structures with binding sites containing metals or histidines, titratable ligands that might change protonation states upon binding, buried sites, protein dimers, etc.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Apr 30, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-04-30/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-04-30/</guid><description>QCFractal: This meeting focused on technical details of how our initial dataset for parameter fitting will be generated.

Boothroyd reported that NIST uncertainty values disappeared after a reformat of the stored data. He has also raised an issue with target uncertainties in the simulations because ThermoML has very low uncertainties and simulations might have to be significantly extended to reach an order of magnitude smaller values. There are several potential ways to address this problem, including running simulations to an absolute uncertainty and analyzing existing entries in ThermoML to understand the range of uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>March 20, 2019 Advisory Board Meeting</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2019-03-20-minutes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2019-03-20-minutes/</guid><description>The Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board met on 20 March, 2019.

Stern is working on a more automated workflow for submitting molecules to QCArchive and getting them run with appropriate defaults. Using OpenEye tools and CMILES could be a problem for running things on QCArchive due to licensing. A lot of work has been done on QCArchive and a press release about how QCArchive interfaces with Open Force Field is coming up soon.
Charges: A charge model API spec is under construction, which should support simple alternatives to AM1 and convert BCC atom types to SMIRKS, among other things.</description></item><item><title>Open Force Field Initiative applies for NIH funding</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/seeking-nih-funding/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/seeking-nih-funding/</guid><description>The ultimate goal of the Open Force Field Initiative is to produce modern, high-quality tools for building better force fields, and to apply these tools to produce consistently more accurate generations of biomolecular force fields that are incredibly easy to use in a variety of molecular simulation packages.

Stern raised the question of how to ensure the same geometry always gets assigned the same atom ordering. D. Smith said that a string comparison is currently possible, where string is contained in a QCEngine job description. J. Chodera thinks that having identical geometries with different atom ordering is highly improbable and should not be a major concern.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Feb 07, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-02-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-02-07/</guid><description>Host-guest calculator: The main topic of discussion was the API design for host-guest calculations. There is a number of decisions that have to be made with respect to input/output requirements, handling different rates of convergence between different systems, how to define and reach targeted uncertainties etc. The current plan envisages the following solutions:
PropertyCalculator would run a simulation in a loop and pause at given intervals to check for convergence and return value, associated uncertainties and location of data files, which is necessary for reweighting, but it will be implemented later on; Initial analysis implementation will involve independent simulations instead of an ensemble analysis to meet a target uncertainty (per-window uncertainty); Returning gradients will be an optional argument, probably in the second generation of fitting with reweighting; As a job input, the estimator should receive a ForceField object and a description of the measured chemical mixture and conditions that it will estimate.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Feb 5, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-02-05/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-02-05/</guid><description>Conformer Generation: C. Stern found that a better way of atom mapping is necessary to keep track of the original map after fragmentation, because sometimes indexed SMILES get re-indexed after fragmentation, which results with the loss of the original map. Occasionally, certain groups that should remain whole end up fragmented.
Torsions / QM Methods: D. Smith suggested that ANI-1 could be a good, fast solution to evaluate energy. It has been decided, though, that for now ANI-1 and semiempirical methods won’t be used for computing torsion scans.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Jan 31, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-31/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-31/</guid><description>Property selection: L.-P. Wang suggested using surface tension for parameter fitting, which isn’t a traditional property used in force field parameterization. A discussion ensued about the merits of using surface tension as one of the target properties, and whether precedents in literature exists. L.-P. Wang described some previous work looking at the simulations of a slab of liquid showing moderate agreement with experiment, and highlighted that, according to the study, the results are relatively consistent as long as the film has no holes.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Jan 24, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-24/</guid><description>API: This meeting focused on API design aspects of PropertyCalculator, including how to tackle situations in which multiple properties with different convergence rates are computed from the same simulation. These properties could be reported asynchronously, as they are being computed, or they could only be returned upon successful completion of all property calculations. It has been decided to build the API with a possibility to allow asynchronous reporting in the future, although this feature is not expected to be implemented in the near-term future.</description></item><item><title>January 23, 2019 Advisory Board Meeting</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2019-01-23-minutes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/minutes/cab/2019-01-23-minutes/</guid><description>The Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board met on 23 Jan 2019.
