##### Force fields released by the Open Force Field Initiative can be accessed in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefields).

The files available for [download](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefields/releases) are in SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) format. Details about this new format are documented in our recent [publication](https://www.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00640) (or [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/286542)), and the most recent specification can be found in the [Open Force Field Toolkit documentation](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smirnoff.html). You can parameterize small molecules with SMIRNOFF using the ForceField class in the [Open Force Field toolkit](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield) for simulations with [OpenMM](http://openmm.org/). The resulting system can also be converted to several other simulation formats using [ParmEd](http://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/html/index.html). Usage examples can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/tree/master/examples).

If you experience any issues with the new force field, please be sure to email support@openforcefield.org or raise an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository.

       * sulfonamides
       * phosphates
       * bridgehead nitrogens
       * bridgehead carbons
       * groups with delocalized charges
   * Fitting procedure related
       * use of physically intuitive bonds and angles from modified-seminario as a starting point
       * data-driven values for improper torsions
       * including dihedral deviations from optimized geometries to better resolve torsion parameters
       * broader coverage of parameters with extended training targets


Find more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc.1), including how to re-run optimization and datasets used in training stored in [sage-2.1.0](https://github.com/openforcefield/sage-2.1.0) repo.

### openff 2.0.0 ###

#### Release date: August 18, 2021

OpenFF 2.0.0 was created using a multi-stage optimization starting from the [OpenFF 1.3.0](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields/releases/tag/1.3.0) force field:

* A select set of the vdW parameters were trained against a set of experimental mass density and enthalpy of mixing measurements sourced from the NIST ThermoML archive.
* A select set of the bond length, bond force constant, equilibrium angle, angle force constant and torsion barrier height parameters were trained against a set of QC computed optimized geometries and torsion profiles, whereby the output force field of the first step  was used as the starting point.

Find more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc.1), including how to re-run optimization and datasets used in training stored in [openff-sage](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage) repo.

Instructions for running each optimization can be found in the individual optimization directories.

## Parsley ##
![Parsley](img/noun_parsley.svg)

_Parsley_ (OpenFF 1.y.z) is the codename for the first generation of optimized small molecule force fields from the Open Force Field Initiative. Parsley force fields represent a refit of the AMBER-lineage _smirnoff99Frosst_ to large sets of quantum chemical data, and assign parameters using direct chemical perception, using the [SMIRNOFF](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smirnoff.html) specification. Read more about the most important aspects of fitting and benchmarking procedures for Parsley in the [blog post](/community/news/general/introducing-openforcefield-1.0/). See more information about naming and semantic versioning [here](/force-fields/versioning/).

All currently available versions are listed below. Each force field is currently available in two forms - with and without bond constraints to hydrogen. The default version of each force field is suitable for typical molecular dynamics simulations with constrained bonds to hydrogen. The unconstrained version of each force field should be used when single-point energies are a major concern (e.g. geometry optimizations) and when comparing the force field to QM data.

## smirnoff99Frosst ##

![smirnoff99Frosst](img/smirnoff99frosst.png)

A minimalist AMBER-compatible general small molecule force field with excellent coverage of druglike chemical space, using the [SMIRNOFF](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.0/smirnoff.html) direct chemical perception specification.

This force field achieves comparable accuracy to GAFF in physical properties, but with a decrease in complexity from over 6000 lines of parameters to only ~300 lines using the SMARTS-based direct chemical perception possible with [SMIRNOFF](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/topology/smirnoff.html). Read more about the latter and creation of _smirnoff99Frosst_ in the [publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00640) or in the [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/286542).

_smirnoff99Frosst_ was used as a starting point to generate the first optimized Open Force Field (Parsley) while building automated infrastructure for rapid parameterization of accurate small molecule force fields.
