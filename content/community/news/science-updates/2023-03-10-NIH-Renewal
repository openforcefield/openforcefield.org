We've been very thankful to recieve significant funding from the NIH Institute of General Medical Sciences for OpenFF over the last three years 
from the Focused Technology Research and Development program. We recently submitted a proposal to renew our funding for four more years, once the 
current grant ends next year. In the interest, of open science, we are [posting the scientific parts of the proposal](../../../science/research/2023_03_06_Open_Force_Field_Initiative_NIH_R01.pdf).

We feel that overall, as part of an open science project, it's better to be open about our plans rather than keep them secret. 
Public disclosure gives us freedom to operate in the event someone else comes into the space and to some extent protects us from commercial competitors, 
as the ideas are publicly disclosed. It's true that someone else could scoops us, on a particlar project; but if they make their work open, then we 
can move on to more of the other things that need to be done, and if it's closed; we'll it probably won't be that useful to people down the road anyway. 
It also helps other researchers and force field communities see what our roadmap will be and identify opportunities to collaborate.
