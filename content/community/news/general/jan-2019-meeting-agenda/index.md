#### Note: Information below this line is mainly relevant to planning and attending the workshop, which has already taken place.

## Directions

The workshop will take place at the Jacobs Medical Center Community & Medical Education Center, Rooms 2 and 3, located at [9300 Campus Point Drive, La Jolla, CA 92037](https://goo.gl/maps/VxCtgVb8wst) (mailing address for the entire medical center), about two miles from nearby hotels.

From hotel, take e.g., [Lyft](http://lyft.com) or [Uber](http://uber.com) to the main entrance of the hospital.
Enter there and walk all the way down the long corridor, past the Cove cafeteria on your left, into the modern Jacobs pavilion.
Continue walking past the elevators to the very end, and the meeting room will be on your right.  
See photos of the route below.

## Meals and breaks

Breakfast, lunch, snacks. and coffee will be provided at the meeting room both days.

The dinner on Day 1 will be held in a private room at the [Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery](https://rockbottom.com/locations/la-jolla/), [8980 Villa La Jolla, La Jolla, CA 92037](https://goo.gl/maps/eeFi5YqTWL42), two miles from the meeting location.
Please use Lyft, Uber, or another carsharing or taxi service to get there.  
We ask that each individual or group pay their own portion of the bill.

### Other discussion topics for the Open Force Field Initiative science team

#### Potential software architecture and infrastructure discussion topics

* Property estimation and automated parameterization (`#propertycalculator`)
* Scaling up property estimation
* If many dependencies are required, do we want to have multiple `conda` packages, or a single monolithic package?
* What should the API for automated parameterization look like to interface with ForceBalance and Bayesian methods?

#### Other potential discussion topics

* Which AMBER biopolymer force field(s) should we target in the first optimized release?
The current recommendation in the AmberTools 18 manual is ff14SB for proteins, so unless there is significant objection, we should probably stick with this.
* Which solvent model should we target in the first optimized release?
TIP3P or TIP4P-Ew?
