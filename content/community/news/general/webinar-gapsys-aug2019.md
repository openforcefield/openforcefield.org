Vytautas Gapsys ([de Groot lab](https://www3.mpibpc.mpg.de/groups/de_groot/bgroot.html)) will be hosted by the [Mobley lab](https://mobleylab.org/) at UC Irvine, where he will present his work on calculations of relative ligand-protein affinities using Gromacs+pmx approach. His talk will also cover a free energy scan based on the non-equilibrium protocol covering ~500 ligand modifications across 13 protein-ligand systems, and provide a comparison of the obtained results to FEP+ calculations. The talk will be followed by a few slides to start discussion about absolute free energies and equilibrium vs. non-equilibrium protocol efficiencies. Remote participants can join this seminar via [Zoom](https://ucihealth.zoom.us/j/163038806) in real time or watch later on YouTube.
