## Interchange Showcase

**Matt Thompson** This session covers the current state of Interchange development and future plans. The example code explores the API points for creating, inspecting, modifying, combining, and exporting parameterized molecular systems using the new Interchange object, and shows examples of how Interchange can be tied into larger workflows.

## Biopolymer Showcase
September 27, 2022

**Josh Mitchell** A session on biopolymer support in OpenFF Toolkit 0.11, showing advanced usage by parametrizing a protein with a post-translational modification (PTM). This workshop demonstrates loading and parametrizing biopolymers with the OpenFF Toolkit, including a preview of support for a non-canonical amino acid. We introduce the Toolkit's new biopolymer support, and then demonstrate a way to apply a post-translational modification. We look at optimizing charge generation by transferring charges generated from a simpler molecule to our new peptide, and then simulate it in OpenMM!

## BespokeFit Showcase
October 19th & 25th, 2022

**Josh Mitchell** An example session on using BespokeFit and incorporating it into your workflows. BespokeFit is an OpenFF package for automatically optimising torsion parameters for arbitrary small molecules. We present a worked example taking a ligand through optimization and simulation
