The [Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board](https://openforcefield.org/about/organization/#open-force-field-consortium) met on 20 March, 2019.
The minutes are summarized as follows:

#### Status Updates

* OFFI NIH proposal submitted and [available publicly](https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/seeking-nih-funding/)
* Hiring update:
  * [Karmen Condic-Jurkic](http://www.choderalab.org/members/#karmen-condic-jurkic) starts April 1 as half-time scientific coordinator/project manager
  * Interviews ongoing for bespoke torsion fitting and potentially electrostatics role

#### [Open Force Field Toolkit](http://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield) update

* Alpha release slated for April 2
* Will contain [RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org/) backend support in abstracted cheminformatics structure (allowing future support for alternative cheminformatics packages to be easily added)
  * Supposed to give same results regardless of RDKit or OpenEye (tested with ~2k molecules from eMolecules to have same energies, forces, and force terms)
  * Differences in aromaticity models could result in some differences in corner cases
  * We are adding a “paranoid mode” so we can detect differences between toolkits that arise when building force fields
* [SDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file#SDF) with standardized tags will be the supported method for importing molecules with custom charges
  * OpenEye and RDKit on-board with standardized tags for charges
* There may have been minor changes to XML forcefield format since the January preview release
  * Changes are summarized [here](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/issues/191)
* OFFI hope is to have weekly/biweekly bugfix or feature releases and conda package updates
* Partners and users are directed to use the [Github issue tracker](ttps://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/issues/) to report issues or problems

#### Technical questions

* How is Desmond currently used by Partners?  What kind of Desmond support is needed?
  * Need for [FEP+](https://www.schrodinger.com/fep) compatibility will likely have to involve discussions with Schrodinger
  * Industry would ideally like to compare forcefields (including OPLS3/3e) and FEP protocols ([FEP+](https://www.schrodinger.com/fep), [YANK](http://getyank.org), etc.)
  * Kaushik to work with PIs to provide some examples for testing
* Desmond’s [`msys`](https://github.com/DEShawResearch/msys) release allows dms files to be written directly, so could be used to construct system with SMIRNOFF parameters
  * Advantage of being independent of Maestro/Schrodinger

#### Reports on usage by partners since January meeting
* Limited use so far - many people awaiting RDKit release to begin internal use
* Training:
  * Plan for YouTube video for basics, followed by webex
  * Mobley to check with Jeff Wagner on training plan
  * Request for tutorial on using SMIRNOFF w/ [YANK](http://getyank.org)
  * Chodera to organize, probably need at least 1 month after April release to integrate SMIRNOFF support into YANK

#### Other stuff

* Poster at [ALCHEMICAL FREE ENERGY WORKSHOP 2019 in Göttingen](http://pmx.mpibpc.mpg.de/workshop_alchemistry2019/index.html).  Thoughts are to highlight OFF Consortium from industry (user) perspective (D. Kuhn, Katharina)
* Daniel and Ross to connect to work on this to coordinate with GRC poster to ensure complimentarity and common usage of some materials.  Mobley to help by providing figures, etc.
* GRC informal session/get-together
  * People still waiting to see who will be attending
  * 1:1 time with Jeff Wagner might be better use of time at the GRC than an organized session
* Next Open Force Field Consortium face-to-face meeting scheduled for August 30-31, 2019 (Friday and Saturday) in San Diego
* Group for evaluating protein-ligand binding free energies being assembled by John Chodera (see Slack) to curate additional benchmark sets
  * Contact John Chodera or post or click “Star” here: https://github.com/alchemistry/soft-benchmarks
