We are hosting the Third [Open Force Field Consortium](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/) Workshop, this time in the online world of Zoom, on May 4-5, 2020. This virtual meeting is replacing the planned in-person gathering in Boston. We decided to slightly experiment with the workshop format by making most of the content available before the meeting for asynchronous consumption. Namely, all talks will be pre-recorded and the meeting time will be focused on discussions around those talks and future planning. The only live presentation will be a keynote on Day 2 by [David Cerutti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-cerutti-11321129), who has recently joined the Open Force Field Initiative as a senior scientist and who will lead the NIH-funded efforts in the biopolymer arena. The main aim of this format is to make this virtual meeting more interactive, and hopefully, more productive.  

#### Talks and discussions

The meeting attendees can join the recording sessions, if they wish, or watch the videos later at their own convenience. Each talk will be 15 min long and there will be 15 min for questions and comments. The talks will be uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh0aJSUm_sYr7nuTzhW806g/featured) on the day when they are recorded. The recording session schedule is provided below and the YouTube links and slides will be shared as soon as the videos have been uploaded. Read in the Zoom policy below how to join the meetings.

Discussion session schedule is in preparation and it will be posted soon, but one of the planned discussions will be focused on user experience. To help us understand better your needs and your use cases, please respond to this [survey](https://forms.gle/5AEbFvHH9wVqnigh7).

#### Zoom policy

The schedule for recording sessions and discussions will be available on the website, however, the Zoom links and passwords will be shared via email with all registered participants. This is a precautionary measure to reduce the probability of Zoom bombing. If any of your colleagues or collaborators would like to join the meeting, please ask them to register here with their institutional email account. All Zoom meetings have the waiting room enabled.

#### Registration

The meeting is primarily intended for the members of the Open Force Field Consortium and Initiative, but all talks and some parts of the meeting are open to the interested members of the community. Please register with your institutional email using the form below (if you use your personal email account you may risk not receiving meeting details). Please note that some discussions might not be open to general public.

Please note that all times refer to the Pacific Time Zone.

Day 1 (Apr 27, 2020)

Time         | Speaker | Talk |
-------------|---------|---------|
8.30 am  | Chaya Stern | <p>**Capturing non-local through-bond effects when fragmenting molecules for QC torsion scans**  <br />  <br /> Wiberg bond orders (WBO) are sensitive to remote substituents and can be used as a surrogate for torsion energy barrier heights. Here we use WBOs to assess the robustness of fragmentation schemes and identify conjugated bond sets.</p> |
9.00 am   | Daniel Smith  |  **QC Archive infrastructure updates** <br />  <br /> Highlights on feature improvements, data artifact generation, and data visualization on the QCArchive website.|
9.30 am	| Jeffrey Wagner |  **Updated on core OpenFF infrastructure** <br />  <br /> New features in the Open Force Field Toolkit, and other developments in core software.

<br />
Day 2 (Apr 28, 2020)

Time         | Speaker | Talk |
-------------|---------|---------|
8.30 am  | David Mobley | **Current Status of OpenFF and our Near-Term Roadmap**  <br />  <br /> I’ll briefly discuss where we are now relative to where we were at the last meeting, and what our near-term horizon looks like for future developments. This will include a brief overview of force field and infrastructure topics of particular interest, with more details to come from other speakers.  |
9.00 am   | Victoria Lim |  **Benchmark assessment of molecular geometries and energies from small molecule force fields** <br />  <br /> I will present my results on a comparison of several small molecule force fields in terms of how well they can reproduce geometries and relative conformer energies with respect to QM reference data.|
9.30 am	| Jessica Maat |  **QM data selection** <br />  <br /> QM data selection for _openff-1.2._ Discussion on how the data set was selected to improve the new force field release.

<br />
Day 3 (Apr 29, 2020)

Time         | Speaker | Talk |
-------------|---------|---------|
8.30 am  | Hyesu Jang | **Update on Parsley minor releases (_openff-1.1.0, 1.2.0_)**  <br />  <br /> Valence parameter re-fitting was done with (1) parameter definition adjustments and (2) newly designed QM training set and the validation of improved performance was carried out.  |
9.00 am   | Simon Boothroyd |  **Which physical properties should we be optimizing against?** <br />  <br /> An update on refitting the non-bonded (LJ) parameters of the OpenFF force fields against physical property data. A focus is given to exploring which types of physical properties yield the largest improvement in force field performance.|
9.30 am	| David Hahn |  **_Parsley_ parameters in protein-ligand binding free energy calculations** <br />  <br /> The calculated binding free energy results between proteins and Parsley-parameterized ligands will be discussed. Alongside, the infrastructure for protein ligand benchmarking is presented.|

<br />
Day 4 (Apr 30, 2020)

Time         | Speaker | Talk |
-------------|---------|---------|
8.30 am  | Josh Fass | **SMIRKS, message-passing, and friends**  <br />  <br /> Comments and exploratory studies on representing chemical environments. |
9.00 am   | Michael Gilson |  **Do we really need so many LJ types?** <br />  <br /> Results of a data-driven investigation. |
9.30 am	| Jeffry Setiadi |  **Host-guest binding calculations with OpenFF evaluator** <br />  <br /> Current status of pAPRika integration with OpenFF Evaluator. |

<br />
Day 5 (May 1, 2020)

Time         | Speaker | Talk |
-------------|---------|---------|
8.30 am  | Owen Madin | **Future directions in parameterization: enabling Bayesian inference with surrogate modeling**  <br />  <br /> I’ll discuss our interest in using Bayesian inference to make decisions about non-bonded interactions, and our planned usage of surrogate models to achieve this. I’ll use the 2CLJQ system as a case study. |
9.00 am   | Yuanqing Wang |  **Near-Chemical Accuracy at Molecular Mechanics Speed: Neural Parameterization of Extended Force Field using Graph Nets** <br />  <br /> By using graph neural networks capable of automatically perceiving chemical environment and directly producing parameters for a fast classical potential, we show it is possible to flexibly assign parameters to near-arbitrary biomolecular systems while achieving near-quantum chemical accuracy with molecular mechanics speed. |
