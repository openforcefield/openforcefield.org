      <description>May 4-5, 2020 | Virtual meeting We hosted the Third Open Force Field Consortium Workshop on May 4-5, 2020 as a virtual meeting. This virtual meeting replaced the planned in-person gathering in Boston. All talks were pre-recorded and the meeting time was focused on discussions and future planning. David Cerutti, who has joined the Open Force Field Initiative as a senior scientist to assist with development of biopolymer force fields funded by the NIH grant, gave a virtual keynote and a brief summary of his talk before discussion.</description>
