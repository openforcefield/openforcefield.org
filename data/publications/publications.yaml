- title: "ChemPer: An Open Source Tool for Automatically Generating SMIRKS Patterns"
  authors: "Caitlin C. Bannan, David Mobley"
  summary:  In this work, we present ChemPer -- a new tool for generating SMIRKS patterns based on clustered fragments (i.e. bonds, angles, or torsions) which should be assigned the same force field parameter. We demonstrate the utility of ChemPer by clustering fragments based on a reference force field, and then regenerating those parameters starting with a simple set of alkanes, ethers, and alcohols.

- title: "Systematic Optimization of Water Models Using Liquid/Vapor Surface Tension Data"
  authors: "Yudong Qiu, Paul S. Nerenberg, Teresa Head-Gordon, Lee-Ping Wang"
  summary: This work investigates whether experimental surface tension measurements, which are less sensitive to quantum and self-polarization corrections, are able to replace the usual reliance on the heat of vaporization as experimental reference data for fitting force field models of molecular liquids.

  authors: "Kyle A. Beauchamp, Julie M. Behr, Ariën S. Rustenburg, Christopher I. Bayly, Kenneth Kroenlein, and John D. Chodera"
  summary: Progress in forcefield validation and parameterization has been hindered by the availability of high-quality machine-readable physical property data for small organic molecules. We show how the NIST ThermoML dataset provides a solution to this problem, and demonstrate its utility in benchmarking the GAFF/AM1-BCC small molecule forcefield on neat liquid densities and static dielectric constants to uncover problems in the representation of low-dielectric environments.

  authors: "David R. Slochower, Niel Henriksen, Lee-Ping Wang, John D. Chodera, David L. Mobley, and Michael K. Gilson"
  summary: "We evaluate the accuracy of SMIRNOFF99Frosst, using free energy calculations of 43 α and β-cyclodextrin host-guest pairs and compare with matched calculations using two versions of GAFF. These results suggest that SMIRNOFF99Frosst performs competitively with existing small molecule force fields and is a parsimonious starting point for optimization."

  authors: "Yudong Qiu, Daniel G. A. Smith, Chaya D. Stern, Mudong Feng, Hyesu Jang, and Lee-Ping Wang"
  summary: "In this paper, we propose a systematic and versatile workflow called TorsionDrive to generate energy-minimized structures on a grid of torsion constraints by means of a recursive wavefront propagation algorithm, which resolves the deficiencies of conventional scanning approaches and generates higher quality QM data for force field development. The method is implemented in an open-source software package that is compatible with many QM software packages and energy minimization codes. The paper also describes integration with the MolSSI QCArchive distributed computing ecosystem."

- title: "Benchmark Assessment of Molecular Geometries and Energies from Small Molecule Force Fields"
  authors: "Victoria T. Lim and David L. Mobley"
  summary: "In this work, we aim to compare six force fields: GAFF, GAFF2, MMFF94, MMFF94S, SMIRNOFF99Frosst, and the openff-1.0.0 (Parsley) force field by focusing on small molecules (< 50 heavy atoms). On a dataset comprising over 26,000 molecular structures, we analyzed their force field-optimized geometries and conformer energies compared to reference quantum mechanical (QM) data. We show that most of these force fields are comparable in accuracy at reproducing gas-phase QM geometries and energetics, but that GAFF/GAFF2/Parsley do slightly better in reproducing QM energies and that MMFF94/MMFF94S perform slightly better in geometries. Parsley shows considerable improvement over its predecessor SMIRNOFF99Frosst, and we identify particular outlying chemical groups for further force field improvement."
