Here, we propose a new approach to force field parameterization in which graph convolutional networks are used to perceive chemical environments and assign molecular mechanics (MM) force field parameters. The entire process of chemical perception and parameter assignment is differentiable end-to-end with respect to model parameters, allowing new force fields to be easily constructed from MM or QM force fields, extended, and applied to arbitrary biomolecules."

  summary: "We present a pipeline for comparing the geometries of small molecule conformers optimized with different force fields. We aimed to identify molecules or chemistries that are particularly informative for future force field development because they display inconsistencies between force fields. We applied our pipeline to a subset of the eMolecules database, and highlighted molecules that appear to be parameterized inconsistently across different force fields. We then identified over-represented functional groups in these molecule sets. The molecules and moieties identified by this pipeline may be particularly helpful for future force field parameterization."

  authors: "Dominic Rufa, Hannah Bruce Macdonald, Josh Fass, Marcus Wieder, Patrick Grinaway, Adrian Roitberg, Olexandr Isayev and John Chodera"
  summary: "This study combines a new generation of hybrid ML/MM potentials and a nonequilibrium perturbation approach to predict protein-ligand binding affinities. With this approach, a standard, GPU-accelerated MM alchemical free energy calculation can be corrected in a simple post-processing step to efficiently recover ML/MM free energies, while delivering a significant accuracy improvement with small additional computational effort. The authors show that it is possible to significantly reduce the error in absolute binding free energies with this new hybrid ML/MM approach ANI2xx/AMBER14SB/TIP3P on Tyk2 benchmarking system. The same set of FE calculations performed with OpenFF-1.0.0 instead of ANI2xx to model ligands achieves RMSE statistically indistinguishable from the [Schrodinger JACS result](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja512751q) for the tested system, which implies that we should expect even better results with the latest Parsley update (OpenFF-1.2.0)."

- title: "Benchmark Assessment of Molecular Geometries and Energies from Small Molecule Force Fields"
  authors: "Victoria T. Lim and David L. Mobley"
  summary: "In this work, we aim to compare six force fields: GAFF, GAFF2, MMFF94, MMFF94S, SMIRNOFF99Frosst, and the openff-1.0.0 (Parsley) force field by focusing on small molecules (< 50 heavy atoms). On a dataset comprising over 26,000 molecular structures, we analyzed their force field-optimized geometries and conformer energies compared to reference quantum mechanical (QM) data. We show that most of these force fields are comparable in accuracy at reproducing gas-phase QM geometries and energetics, but that GAFF/GAFF2/Parsley do slightly better in reproducing QM energies and that MMFF94/MMFF94S perform slightly better in geometries. Parsley version OpenFF-1.0.0 shows considerable improvement over its predecessor SMIRNOFF99Frosst, while OpenFF-1.2.0 performs even better with accuracy comparable to other available general force fields. We identify particular outlying chemical groups for further force field improvement."

- title: "Driving torsion scans with wavefront propagation"
  authors: "Yudong Qiu, Daniel G. A. Smith, Chaya D. Stern, Mudong Feng, Hyesu Jang, and Lee-Ping Wang"
  summary: "In this paper, we propose a systematic and versatile workflow called TorsionDrive to generate energy-minimized structures on a grid of torsion constraints by means of a recursive wavefront propagation algorithm, which resolves the deficiencies of conventional scanning approaches and generates higher quality QM data for force field development. The method is implemented in an open-source software package that is compatible with many QM software packages and energy minimization codes. The paper also describes integration with the MolSSI QCArchive distributed computing ecosystem."

  authors: "David R. Slochower, Niel Henriksen, Lee-Ping Wang, John D. Chodera, David L. Mobley, and Michael K. Gilson"
  summary: "We evaluate the accuracy of SMIRNOFF99Frosst, using free energy calculations of 43 α and β-cyclodextrin host-guest pairs and compare with matched calculations using two versions of GAFF. These results suggest that SMIRNOFF99Frosst performs competitively with existing small molecule force fields and is a parsimonious starting point for optimization."

  authors: "Yuanqing Wang and Josh Fass and Chaya D. Stern and John Chodera"
  summary: Graph convolutional and message-passing networks can be a powerful tool for predicting physical properties of small molecules when coupled to a simple physical model that encodes the relevant invariances. Here, we show the ability of graph nets to predict partial atomic charges for use in molecular dynamics simulations and physical docking.

- title: "ChemPer: An Open Source Tool for Automatically Generating SMIRKS Patterns"
  authors: "Caitlin C. Bannan, David Mobley"
  summary:  In this work, we present ChemPer -- a new tool for generating SMIRKS patterns based on clustered fragments (i.e. bonds, angles, or torsions) which should be assigned the same force field parameter. We demonstrate the utility of ChemPer by clustering fragments based on a reference force field, and then regenerating those parameters starting with a simple set of alkanes, ethers, and alcohols.

  summary: This work investigates whether experimental surface tension measurements, which are less sensitive to quantum and self-polarization corrections, are able to replace the usual reliance on the heat of vaporization as experimental reference data for fitting force field models of molecular liquids.

  summary: Progress in forcefield validation and parameterization has been hindered by the availability of high-quality machine-readable physical property data for small organic molecules. We show how the NIST ThermoML dataset provides a solution to this problem, and demonstrate its utility in benchmarking the GAFF/AM1-BCC small molecule forcefield on neat liquid densities and static dielectric constants to uncover problems in the representation of low-dielectric environments.
