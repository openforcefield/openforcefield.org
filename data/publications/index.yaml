  authors: "Simon Boothroyd, Lee-Ping Wang, David Mobley, John Chodera, and Michael Shirts"
  summary: "Parameterization and assessment of force fields against high-quality, condensed phase physical property data is an integral aspect of force field development. Here we present an entirely automated, highly scalable framework for evaluating physical properties and their gradients in terms of force field parameters. It is written as a modular and extensible Python framework, which employs an intelligent multiscale estimation approach that allows for the automated estimation of properties from simulation and cached simulation data, and a pluggable API for estimation of new properties. In this study we demonstrate the utility of the framework by benchmarking the OpenFF 1.0.0 small molecule force field, GAFF 1.8 and GAFF 2.1 force fields against a test set of binary density and enthalpy of mixing measurements curated using the frameworks utilities. Further, we demonstrate the framework's utility as part of force field optimization by using it alongside ForceBalance, a framework for systematic force field optimization, to retrain a set of non-bonded van der Waals parameters against a training set of density and enthalpy of vaporization measurements."

  summary: "As new methods, force fields, and implementations are developed, assessing the expected accuracy of free energy calculations on real-world systems (benchmarking) becomes critical to provide users with an assessment of the accuracy expected when these methods are applied within their domain of applicability, and developers with a way to assess the expected impact of new methodologies. Here, we present guidelines for (1) curating experimental data to develop meaningful benchmark sets, (2) preparing benchmark inputs according to best practices to facilitate widespread adoption, and (3) analysis of the resulting predictions to enable statistically meaningful comparisons among methods and force fields."

  authors: "Yudong Qiu, Daniel Smith, Simon Boothroyd, Hyesu Jang, Jeffrey Wagner, Caitlin C. Bannan, Trevor Gokey, Victoria T. Lim, Chaya Stern, Andrea Rizzi, Xavier Lucas, Bryon Tjanaka, Michael R. Shirts, Michael Gilson, John Chodera, Christopher I. Bayly, David Mobley, Lee-Ping Wang"
  summary: "We describe the structure and optimization of the Open Force Field 1.0.0 small molecule force field, code-named Parsley. Parsley uses the SMIRKS-native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) parameter assignment formalism in which parameter types are assigned directly by chemical perception, in contrast to traditional atom type-based approaches. This method provides a natural means to incorporate increasingly diverse chemistry without needlessly increasing force field complexity. In this work, we present essentially a full optimization of the valence parameters in the force field. The optimization was carried out with the ForceBalance tool and was informed by reference quantum chemical data that include torsion potential energy profiles, optimized gas-phase structures, and vibrational frequencies. These data were computed and are maintained with QCArchive, an open-source and freely available distributed computing and database software ecosystem. Tests of the resulting force field against compounds and data types outside the training set show improvements in optimized geometries and conformational energetics and demonstrate that Parsley's accuracy for liquid properties is similar to that of other general force fields."

  authors: "Yuanqing Wang, Josh Fass, and John D. Chodera"
  summary: "Molecular mechanics force fields have been a workhorse for computational chemistry and drug discovery. Here, we propose a new approach to force field parameterization in which graph convolutional networks are used to perceive chemical environments and assign molecular mechanics (MM) force field parameters. The entire process of chemical perception and parameter assignment is differentiable end-to-end with respect to model parameters, allowing new force fields to be easily constructed from MM or QM force fields, extended, and applied to arbitrary biomolecules."

  authors: "Chaya D. Stern, Christopher I. Bayly, Daniel G. A. Smith, Josh Fass, Lee-Ping Wang, David L. Mobley, and John D. Chodera"
  summary: "We show how the Wiberg Bond Order (WBO) can be used to construct small molecule fragmentation schemes that will avoid disrupting the chemical environment around torsions. The resulting fragmentation scheme powers the QCSubmit tool used to fragment and inject small molecule datasets into the QCFractal computation pipeline for deposition into the QCArchive quantum chemistry archive the Open Force Field Initiative uses for constructing force fields, as well as powering bespoke torsion refitting for individual molecules."

  authors: "Jordan Ehrman, Victoria T. Lim, Caitlin C. Bannan, Nam Thi, Daisy Kyu, and David Mobley"
  summary: "We present a pipeline for comparing the geometries of small molecule conformers optimized with different force fields. We aimed to identify molecules or chemistries that are particularly informative for future force field development because they display inconsistencies between force fields. We applied our pipeline to a subset of the eMolecules database, and highlighted molecules that appear to be parameterized inconsistently across different force fields. We then identified over-represented functional groups in these molecule sets. The molecules and moieties identified by this pipeline may be particularly helpful for future force field parameterization."

  authors: "Dominic Rufa, Hannah Bruce Macdonald, Josh Fass, Marcus Wieder, Patrick Grinaway, Adrian Roitberg, Olexandr Isayev and John Chodera"
  summary: "This study combines a new generation of hybrid ML/MM potentials and a nonequilibrium perturbation approach to predict protein-ligand binding affinities. With this approach, a standard, GPU-accelerated MM alchemical free energy calculation can be corrected in a simple post-processing step to efficiently recover ML/MM free energies, while delivering a significant accuracy improvement with small additional computational effort. The authors show that it is possible to significantly reduce the error in absolute binding free energies with this new hybrid ML/MM approach ANI2xx/AMBER14SB/TIP3P on Tyk2 benchmarking system. The same set of FE calculations performed with OpenFF-1.0.0 instead of ANI2xx to model ligands achieves RMSE statistically indistinguishable from the [Schrodinger JACS result](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja512751q) for the tested system, which implies that we should expect even better results with the latest Parsley update (OpenFF-1.2.0)."

- title: "Benchmark Assessment of Molecular Geometries and Energies from Small Molecule Force Fields"
  authors: "Victoria T. Lim and David L. Mobley"
  summary: "In this work, we aim to compare six force fields: GAFF, GAFF2, MMFF94, MMFF94S, SMIRNOFF99Frosst, and the openff-1.0.0 (Parsley) force field by focusing on small molecules (< 50 heavy atoms). On a dataset comprising over 26,000 molecular structures, we analyzed their force field-optimized geometries and conformer energies compared to reference quantum mechanical (QM) data. We show that most of these force fields are comparable in accuracy at reproducing gas-phase QM geometries and energetics, but that GAFF/GAFF2/Parsley do slightly better in reproducing QM energies and that MMFF94/MMFF94S perform slightly better in geometries. Parsley version OpenFF-1.0.0 shows considerable improvement over its predecessor SMIRNOFF99Frosst, while OpenFF-1.2.0 performs even better with accuracy comparable to other available general force fields. We identify particular outlying chemical groups for further force field improvement."

  authors: "Yudong Qiu, Daniel G. A. Smith, Chaya D. Stern, Mudong Feng, Hyesu Jang, and Lee-Ping Wang"
  summary: "In this paper, we propose a systematic and versatile workflow called TorsionDrive to generate energy-minimized structures on a grid of torsion constraints by means of a recursive wavefront propagation algorithm, which resolves the deficiencies of conventional scanning approaches and generates higher quality QM data for force field development. The method is implemented in an open-source software package that is compatible with many QM software packages and energy minimization codes. The paper also describes integration with the MolSSI QCArchive distributed computing ecosystem."

These results suggest that SMIRNOFF99Frosst performs competitively with existing small molecule force fields and is a parsimonious starting point for optimization."

  summary:  In this work, we present ChemPer -- a new tool for generating SMIRKS patterns based on clustered fragments (i.e. bonds, angles, or torsions) which should be assigned the same force field parameter. We demonstrate the utility of ChemPer by clustering fragments based on a reference force field, and then regenerating those parameters starting with a simple set of alkanes, ethers, and alcohols.
