One of the challenges is to find the right balance between the current and future parameterization needs, which includes making decisions about specific properties to be used for the first optimization sprint and specific chemistry that will be covered in this sprint (and maybe in the next one). For the latter, finding a set of molecules (SMILES) that exercise all SMIRNOFF parameters is desirable and J.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Feb 07, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-02-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-02-07/</guid><description>Host-guest calculator: The main topic of discussion was the API design for host-guest calculations. There is a number of decisions that have to be made with respect to input/output requirements, handling different rates of convergence between different systems, how to define and reach targeted uncertainties etc. The current plan envisages the following solutions:
PropertyCalculator would run a simulation in a loop and pause at given intervals to check for convergence and return value, associated uncertainties and location of data files, which is necessary for reweighting, but it will be implemented later on; Initial analysis implementation will involve independent simulations instead of an ensemble analysis to meet a target uncertainty (per-window uncertainty); Returning gradients will be an optional argument, probably in the second generation of fitting with reweighting; As a job input, the estimator should receive a ForceField object and a description of the measured chemical mixture and conditions that it will estimate.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Jan 24, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-24/</guid><description>API: This meeting focused on API design aspects of PropertyCalculator, including how to tackle situations in which multiple properties with different convergence rates are computed from the same simulation. These properties could be reported asynchronously, as they are being computed, or they could only be returned upon successful completion of all property calculations. It has been decided to build the API with a possibility to allow asynchronous reporting in the future, although this feature is not expected to be implemented in the near-term future.</description></item></channel></rss>
