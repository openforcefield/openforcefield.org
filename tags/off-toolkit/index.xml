      <description>QCFractal: D. Smith announced that version 0.7 is out and update is recommended. Currently, QCPortal doesnâ€™t check the QCFractal versions, so some unexpected errors may occur if users do not upgrade from 0.6. The QCArchive team is also planning to migrate the database from MongoDB to PostgreSQL during this week for some long-term benefits, including speed, smaller size and data integrity. More details about this migration should come in a blog post.</description>

      <description>This meeting generally focused on planning for the first round of parameter optimization.

Torsion Workflow: J. Chodera led a short discussion on the overall shape of the final workflow, and what the interface would be to push molecules through it.</description>
