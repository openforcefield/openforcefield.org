This virtual meeting is replacing the planned in-person gathering in Boston. We decided to slightly experiment with the workshop format by making most of the content available before the meeting for asynchronous consumption. Namely, all talks will be pre-recorded and the meeting time will be focused on discussions around those talks and future planning.</description></item><item><title>The Third Open Force Field Consortium Workshop</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/may2020-meeting-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/may2020-meeting-announcement/</guid><description>The in-person meeting in Boston has been cancelled due to COVID-19 outbreak.
