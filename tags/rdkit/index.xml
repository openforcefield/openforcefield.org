      <description>QCFractal: D. Smith announced that version 0.7 is out and update is recommended. Currently, QCPortal doesnâ€™t check the QCFractal versions, so some unexpected errors may occur if users do not upgrade from 0.6.

More details about this migration should come in a blog post.</description>

While we expect the updated toolkit to be released very soon, we wanted to provide a summary of the coming changes to give you an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:</description>
