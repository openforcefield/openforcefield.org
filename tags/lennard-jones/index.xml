      <title>Webinar by Andreas Krämer: Automated Optimization Approaches for the CHARMM Lipid Force Field (Dec 17, 2019)</title>

      <description>Andreas Krämer (NIH) will give a talk about development of an automated optimization approach to improve the CHARMM36 lipid force field using pair-specific LJ parameters. Join the seminar via Zoom in real time on Dec 17 at 2 pm (ET), or watch it later on our YouTube channel.
**Abstract:** The [CHARMM36 (C36) lipid force field](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922408/) is well-validated for many properties of monolayers and bilayers and has been cited in over 2000 studies of membrane simulations.</description>

      <description>Chemical coverage C. Bayly suggested broadly dividing parameters into two categories: 1) chemistry being covered in the first optimization run; 2) everything else. The latter category should also include information about all molecules that were cleaned out from databases used in the first optimization sprint, which was focused on improvement of a selected (sub)set of parameters. This information (data) can be used in the later stages of the force field optimization when chemical coverage will be expanded.</description>

      <description>Datasets: Still waiting for NIST approval for data release from ThermoML. DIPPR was contacted to explain the terms of use for their data in more details. DIPPR contains pure component data on industrially important chemical compounds.
PropertyEstimator: PropertyEstimator (PE) and ForceBalance (FB) seem to be working well based on the preliminary tests run by S. Boothroyd, and the infrastructure is ready for the initial LJ fitting. There are some differences in the gradients calculated by PE and FB.</description>

      <title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Jul 25, 2019)</title>

      <description>Today the PropertyEstimator group discussed our progress, moving forward towards our fitting process with ThermoML data and ForceBalance. Decisions about fitting techniques and data have been made, and we are moving on to testing and production.
Database readiness
S. Boothroyd has algorithmically selected a basic set from the ThermoML archive with coverage of our selected Lennard Jones parameters. For basic fitting, we are moving forward with this dataset; if time allows we will also include a hand-curated ThermoML dataset provided by Lee-Ping Wang.</description>

      <description>Types We will use the same typing tree as smirnoff99Frosst (with some minor adjustments to specific bugs or other problems), but optimize the differentiable parameters in (a subset of) torsion, valence, and Lennard-Jones parameters.
Parameterization We will aim to refit (a subset of) torsions, valence terms, and Lennard-Jones parameters, depending on what is ready in time. In practice, we have decoupled efforts to fit all three that should be straightforward to couple together in our final optimization stage.</description>

      <title>Towards New Fixed Charge Models</title>
      <link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/2019-07-05-charge-model-update/</link>

      <description>The Open Force Field Initiative continues to explore new partial charge assignment models for both fast parameterization (to allow billion-compound sets to be rapidly parameterized for docking) and a more accurate &amp;ldquo;bespoke&amp;rdquo; parameterization pipeline for torsions and partial charges (intended for use with more accurate but more costly methods, such as free energy calculations).&amp;quot;
A new version of the Restrained Electrostatic Potential Method (RESP2): RESP2 aims to improve the electrostatic description via point charges, in comparison to the popular existing RESP (here referred to as “RESP1”) and AM1-BCC methods.</description>
