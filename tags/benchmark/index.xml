Recently, the second generation of small molecule force field “Sage” (OpenFF 2.y.z) was released, featuring a retrained Lennard-Jones parameters in addition to continued improvements to the valence parameters. In this report, academic and industrial partners of the OpenFF Initiative worked together to assess the performance of recent OpenFF releases and other small molecule FFs against reference quantum mechanical (QM) calculations at the B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP level of theory.</description></item></channel></rss>
