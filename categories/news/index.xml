This grant is funded through the NIGMS Focused Technology Research &amp;amp; Development R01 program, which supports the development of innovative new technologies that enable biological discovery.
This support has been essential in enabling us to better serve the molecular simulation and force field development community.</description></item><item><title>5th Open Force Field Workshop (2022)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/5th-openff-workshop-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/5th-openff-workshop-2022/</guid><description>On June 28, 2022 we had our 5th annual meeting.

Recent highlights have included the release of a series of updates to Parsley, a small molecule force field for biomolecular simulation, which is now at version OpenFF-1.2.0. Parsley was iteratively optimized to improve agreement with quantum chemical geometries, energetics, and vibrational frequencies.
Here, we provide a preliminary benchmark assessment of several small molecule force fields (FF) compared to quantum mechanical (QM) results regarding gas phase energies and geometries of a set of molecule conformers.</description></item><item><title>Lee-Ping Wang stepping down from a leadership role</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/lpw-stepdown/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/general/lpw-stepdown/</guid><description>From August 1, the Open Force Field Initiative will undergo a change in the leadership team, as Lee-Ping Wang has decided to step down from his role as an OpenFF primary investigator.
