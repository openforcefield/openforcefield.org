This is why initiatives like the Open Force Field, which aim to turn cutting-edge scientific research into valuable technology, need ongoing support. By providing long-term support to these initiatives, we can ensure that they can continue to develop and deliver comprehensive solutions that are accessible to all. It is important to recognize that the success of initiatives like the Open Force Field relies on ongoing interest and support.</description></item><item><title>Training force field parameters to Host-Guest binding</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/fitting_gbsa_parameters-openff-2022-08-29/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/fitting_gbsa_parameters-openff-2022-08-29/</guid><description>Would you like to train your force field to fit binding data? Most force fields are tuned to reproduce liquid state properties. Setting up simulations to perform the binding calculations and optimizing specific force field parameters may be laborious work. However, the Open Force Field infrastructure provides the tools to achieve this in an automated way. In this blog post, I will show an example of tuning GBSA parameters to host-guest binding data using Open Force Field.</description></item><item><title>Open Source, Enterprise-level Data Pipeline</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/dataset_generation-openff-2022-06-13/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/dataset_generation-openff-2022-06-13/</guid><description>In this blogpost I would like to introduce you to our molecular dataset generation workflow. At Open Force Field, we generate a lot of Quantum Mechanics (QM) data as well as Molecular Mechanics (MM) data, predominantly for drug-like small molecules. A few data oriented tasks include:
training the valence parameters in the force field benchmarking the force field building bespoke parameters based on fragment torsions building machine learning models to predict charges building machine learned potentials and many more analyses to answer scientific questions related to virtual sites, polarizability, etc.</description></item><item><title>BespokeFit release</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/bespokefit-update-2022-05-12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/bespokefit-update-2022-05-12/</guid><description>We are very pleased to officially announce the release of üéâopenff-bespokefitüéâ for public use. The OpenFF BespokeFit framework aims to offer a completely automated workflow for creating bespoke, highly accurate, torsion parameters in the OpenFF SMIRNOFF format. Following our very early alpha preview late last year we have been hard at work to improve the experience that users can expect with BespokeFit, concentrating on a few key aspects:
Reliability: BespokeFit should be able to reliably derive bespoke parameters for a wide range of drug-like molecules and so we have reworked our reference data generation to work with the fantastic QCEngine to offer a reliable and reproducible fitting experience.</description></item><item><title>Benchmark: Collaborative assessment of molecular geometries and energies from the OpenFF</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/benchmarking-openff-2022-04-15/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/benchmarking-openff-2022-04-15/</guid><description>The Open Force Field (OpenFF) Initiative focuses to build, optimize and assess a general force field (FF) using an automated and reproducible procedure, with all software, data, and workflows made freely available. Recently, the second generation of small molecule force field ‚ÄúSage‚Äù (OpenFF 2.y.z) was released, featuring a retrained Lennard-Jones parameters in addition to continued improvements to the valence parameters. In this report, academic and industrial partners of the OpenFF Initiative worked together to assess the performance of recent OpenFF releases and other small molecule FFs against reference quantum mechanical (QM) calculations at the B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP level of theory.</description></item><item><title>We can have nice things</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/docs-update-2022-1-19/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/docs-update-2022-1-19/</guid><description>I think in scientific computing we can be so focused on the problems we&amp;rsquo;re solving that we&amp;rsquo;re slow to pick up new tooling that merely makes our lives easier. It&amp;rsquo;s like we imagine that, since we&amp;rsquo;re scientists, we have to make do with what we&amp;rsquo;ve got because we don&amp;rsquo;t have time to get anything better. But we can have nice things too; in this day and age, we are fortunate to have an enormous amount of high-quality tooling that means that many errors are caught before they make it to a release: GitHub Actions, conda-forge, PyTest, Black, Mamba, MyPy.</description></item><item><title>Interchange project update</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/interchange-update-2021-11-10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/interchange-update-2021-11-10/</guid><description>Thus far, the only simulation engine natively supported by export from the OpenFF software stack has been OpenMM. OpenMM offers great performance on GPUs and excellent flexibility via its API, but many scientists wish to use tools that are only compatible with other molecular simulation engines, like AMBER and GROMACS. There are tools that can convert OpenMM objects to file formats understood by these other engines, but these steps can have rough edges and add complexity to users&amp;rsquo; workflows.</description></item><item><title>How to train your force field 2: Bespoke fit</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/bespokefit-update-2021-10-20/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/bespokefit-update-2021-10-20/</guid><description>General transferable force fields, such as Parsley or Sage, allow us to rapidly parameterize small molecules covering vast amounts of chemical space for use in molecular dynamics simulations. However, with every force field comes the inherent assumption that parameters fit to a set of representative molecules in a training set are transferable to any new molecules with similar chemistry. Despite potential accuracy problems caused by poor transferability or discrete atom types the use of force fields in fields like drug discovery has been a massive success.</description></item><item><title>Surrogate-enabled Bayesian sampling of force field parameters</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/bayesian-surrogate-modeling-2021-09-03/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/bayesian-surrogate-modeling-2021-09-03/</guid><description>In the Open Force Field Initiative, we are always looking for novel ways to advance force field parameterization. Working on the parameterization of Lennard-Jones models, one strategy I am exploring is using Bayesian inference to explore parameter landscapes with respect to physical properties. This is a lot to parse in one sentence, so let&amp;rsquo;s break it down!
Lennard-Jones parameterization relies on physical properties Since the earliest days of force field science, LJ parameters have been fitted against physical property datasets ( typically liquid densities and heats of vaporization).</description></item><item><title>Searching chemical space</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/searching-chemical-space-2021-07-26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/searching-chemical-space-2021-07-26/</guid><description>The basis of SMIRNOFF is the use of SMIRKS (or SMARTS) patterns to define parameters. This has a lot of benefits and makes parameter design and force field fitting a unique experience. Because of this uniqueness I have found a need to use SMARTS in a way that just hasn&amp;rsquo;t been needed until now. SMARTS are normally applied to a SMILES pattern which makes SMARTS a type of substructure query on a molecule.</description></item><item><title>How to train your force field</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/ff-training-example-2021-07-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/ff-training-example-2021-07-01/</guid><description>Within Open Force Field (as the name might suggest) a lot of time and effort is spent exploring exactly how should force fields be trained - what data should be fit to? how should that data influence the optimization e.g. L1, L2? what classical functional forms should be used for the force field interactions? or should everything just be machine learned a la ANI and friends.
A big part of this process is automation.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure Lessons-learned</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/infrastructure-update-2021-05-19/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/infrastructure-update-2021-05-19/</guid><description>It‚Äôs been more than a year since our last blog post, far longer than we could reasonably blame on lockdowns. This post will be an update after a year of software development and operational lessons-learned. In some ways this post may be interesting for an actual software person to read, since getting myself to this point required so many years of biology, chemistry, physics, and CS, that I never formally learned software engineering or project management, yet those have gradually become my primary roles in the organization.</description></item><item><title>Version 1.1.0 "Parsley" Update</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/v1.1.0-parsley-update-2020-03-03/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/v1.1.0-parsley-update-2020-03-03/</guid><description>Description We are pleased to announce the release of our first &amp;ldquo;Parsley&amp;rdquo; update.

It focused on deciding future directions toward publication, infrastructure development, and lining up for the next FF release.
Once Simon Boothroyd begins work in Colorado, Simon and Owen will present a proposed Property Estimator paper outline to the consortium. This will involve choosing which of several existing questions to address, including: The extent to which our current functional form introduces errors in polyhalogenated compounds, due to an inability to model sigma holes.</description></item><item><title>Release-1 update (Aug 15, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/release-1-update-2019-08-20/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/release-1-update-2019-08-20/</guid><description>Chemical coverage C. Bayly suggested broadly dividing parameters into two categories: 1) chemistry being covered in the first optimization run; 2) everything else. The latter category should also include information about all molecules that were cleaned out from databases used in the first optimization sprint, which was focused on improvement of a selected (sub)set of parameters. This information (data) can be used in the later stages of the force field optimization when chemical coverage will be expanded.</description></item><item><title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Aug 08, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-08-08/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-08-08/</guid><description>Datasets: Still waiting for NIST approval for data release from ThermoML. DIPPR was contacted to explain the terms of use for their data in more details. DIPPR contains pure component data on industrially important chemical compounds.
PropertyEstimator: PropertyEstimator (PE) and ForceBalance (FB) seem to be working well based on the preliminary tests run by S. Boothroyd, and the infrastructure is ready for the initial LJ fitting. There are some differences in the gradients calculated by PE and FB.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (August 6, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-08-06/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-08-06/</guid><description>Release-1:: In this meeting, L.-P.Wang and Y. Qiu reported on the results of a newly-implemented workflow which performs a MM minimization of torsion-driven structures before parameter optimization. Y. Qiu showed some results of the fitting with this change. It was generally agreed that this additional step improved the quality of the fitting, and was helpful in almost all cases. It was suggested that L.-P. Wang and Y.

Parameterization We will aim to refit (a subset of) torsions, valence terms, and Lennard-Jones parameters, depending on what is ready in time. In practice, we have decoupled efforts to fit all three that should be straightforward to couple together in our final optimization stage.</description></item><item><title>Property Estimator Meeting Summary (Jul 11, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-07-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertyestimator-meeting-2019-07-11/</guid><description>Dataset sources
NIST update: Data that was collected and curated in an automated process by NIST could be released as an open dataset, but not the manually curated uncertainties, which is the step that follows automated curation. Additional problem may arise from the fact that data from before 10 years ago simply isn‚Äôt present in ThermoML. Until the situation is clear from the legal perspective, it has been decided to move forward using the data from an older release of ThermoML which contained author-assigned uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Jul 9, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-07-09/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-07-09/</guid><description>Fragmenter: C.

Boothroyd reported that NIST uncertainty values disappeared after a reformat of the stored data. He has also raised an issue with target uncertainties in the simulations because ThermoML has very low uncertainties and simulations might have to be significantly extended to reach an order of magnitude smaller values. There are several potential ways to address this problem, including running simulations to an absolute uncertainty and analyzing existing entries in ThermoML to understand the range of uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Mar 19, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-03-19/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-03-19/</guid><description>QCArchive: C. Stern is working on a more automated workflow for submitting molecules to QCArchive and getting them run with appropriate defaults. Using OpenEye tools and CMILES could be a problem for running things on QCArchive due to licensing. A lot of work has been done on QCArchive and a press release about how QCArchive interfaces with Open Force Field is coming up soon.
Charges: A charge model API spec is under construction, which should support simple alternatives to AM1 and convert BCC atom types to SMIRKS, among other things.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Mar 5, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-03-05/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-03-05/</guid><description>TorsionDrive: Y. Qiu started working on TorsionDrive and was unable to replicate D. Smith&amp;rsquo;s previously reported issue with 120 degree scan intervals. D. Smith confirmed that he was also unable to replicate and he suspects it might have been a version issue.
QCFractal: Stable version of QCFractal is out and should be installed through pip or conda - always conda install qcportal -c conda-forge. QCPortal might throw an error if an older version of QCFractal is used.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Feb 21, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-02-21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-02-21/</guid><description>This call focused on RJMC preliminary results for surrogate models (O.

Stern raised the question of how to ensure the same geometry always gets assigned the same atom ordering. D. Smith said that a string comparison is currently possible, where string is contained in a QCEngine job description. J. Chodera thinks that having identical geometries with different atom ordering is highly improbable and should not be a major concern.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Feb 07, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-02-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-02-07/</guid><description>Host-guest calculator: The main topic of discussion was the API design for host-guest calculations. There is a number of decisions that have to be made with respect to input/output requirements, handling different rates of convergence between different systems, how to define and reach targeted uncertainties etc. The current plan envisages the following solutions:
PropertyCalculator would run a simulation in a loop and pause at given intervals to check for convergence and return value, associated uncertainties and location of data files, which is necessary for reweighting, but it will be implemented later on; Initial analysis implementation will involve independent simulations instead of an ensemble analysis to meet a target uncertainty (per-window uncertainty); Returning gradients will be an optional argument, probably in the second generation of fitting with reweighting; As a job input, the estimator should receive a ForceField object and a description of the measured chemical mixture and conditions that it will estimate.</description></item><item><title>Torsion Meeting Summary (Feb 5, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-02-05/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/torsion-meeting-2019-02-05/</guid><description>Conformer Generation: C. Stern found that a better way of atom mapping is necessary to keep track of the original map after fragmentation, because sometimes indexed SMILES get re-indexed after fragmentation, which results with the loss of the original map. Occasionally, certain groups that should remain whole end up fragmented.
Torsions / QM Methods: D. Smith suggested that ANI-1 could be a good, fast solution to evaluate energy. It has been decided, though, that for now ANI-1 and semiempirical methods won‚Äôt be used for computing torsion scans.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Jan 31, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-31/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-31/</guid><description>Property selection: L.-P. Wang suggested using surface tension for parameter fitting, which isn‚Äôt a traditional property used in force field parameterization. A discussion ensued about the merits of using surface tension as one of the target properties, and whether precedents in literature exists. L.-P. Wang described some previous work looking at the simulations of a slab of liquid showing moderate agreement with experiment, and highlighted that, according to the study, the results are relatively consistent as long as the film has no holes.</description></item><item><title>Property Calculator Meeting Summary (Jan 24, 2019)</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/propertycalculator-meeting-2019-01-24/</guid><description>API: This meeting focused on API design aspects of PropertyCalculator, including how to tackle situations in which multiple properties with different convergence rates are computed from the same simulation. These properties could be reported asynchronously, as they are being computed, or they could only be returned upon successful completion of all property calculations. It has been decided to build the API with a possibility to allow asynchronous reporting in the future, although this feature is not expected to be implemented in the near-term future.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure Update</title><link>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/2019-01-22-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openforcefield.org/community/news/science-updates/2019-01-22-infrastructure/</guid><description>Participants Caitlin Bannan (Mobley group), Simon Boothroyd (Chodera group), John Chodera (MSKCC), Hyesu Jang (Wang group), Victoria Lim (Mobley group), Jessica Maat (Mobley group), Owen Madin (Shirts group), David Mobley (UC Irvine), Levi Naden (MolSSI), Jessica Nash (MolSSI), Yudong Qiu (Wang group), Andrea Rizzi (Chodera group), Michael Schauperl (Gilson group), David Slochower (Gilson group), Daniel Smith (MolSSI), Chaya Stern (Chodera group), Jeff Wagner (OpenFF), Lee-Ping Wang (UC Davis)
