# openforcefield.org website source

OpenFF website is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Detailed content structure documentation is available in `content/manual/_index.md`.
 
## Making changes

1. Create a local copy of the OpenFF website repo: `git clone https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield.org`. Make sure you are on the default `v2` branch (`git checkout v2`) before you  `git pull`.   
2. Create a new branch with `git checkout -b <mybranch>`, where `<mybranch>` is the name of your new branch.
3. Make changes and preview the site locally in your browser (see below) to make sure that your page display as intended.
4. Commit the changes (`git commit .`) and push the repository to your branch (`git push origin <mybranch>`).
5. Open a PR and request review.
6. When ready, merge your PR into the `v2` branch. Deployment is automatically handled by a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield.org/actions) named `github pages` followed by the automated GitHub deployment to `gh-pages` branch of `openforcefield.org`, which the website is served from.
